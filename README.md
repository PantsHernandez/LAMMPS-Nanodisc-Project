# Nanodisc simulation project
# This LAMMPS script simulates the orderphobic behavior of a membrane protein inserted into the lipid bilayer of a nanodisc.
# Lipid and Protein particles are course grained to single particles for simplicity.
# This simulation provides insight into how the size of a nanodisc may affect the behavior of membrane proteins.
